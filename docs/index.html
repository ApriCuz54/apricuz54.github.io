                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Aditya Chatterjee, an enthusiastic problem solver with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently pursuing my B.E. (Hons.) in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, and have worked on several exciting projects in the field of deep learning, image processing, and handwritten recognition.</p>
                <p>I've interned at AMD, where I focused on optimizing deep learning models for Ryzen AI devices, enhancing performance and efficiency. Previously, I also worked as a Business Growth Intern at Ultrahive Healthcare, where I contributed to go-to-market strategies and digital marketing campaigns.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball as part of the BITS Goa team and I have also achieved Grade 8 certification in Western Classical Guitar.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my projects below and check out my GitHub for more information!</p>

                <h3>AMD - AIG AI Solutions</h3>
                <p>During my internship at AMD, I worked on optimizing large language models (LLMs) to run efficiently on Neural Processing Units (NPUs), with a specific focus on ensuring compatibility with AMD’s RyzenAI chips. My team's primary focus during my team here was enabling Copilot+ on Windows machines globally. This task required an in-depth understanding of LLM architecture and familiarity with machine learning frameworks like ONNX and ONNXRuntime.</p>
                <p>To meet the goals, I developed a production-level package designed to optimize LLMs by pre-processing model layers and formatting data for efficient NPU deployment. This package, which was sent to customers, delivered up to a 300% improvement in model initialization speed on NPUs. This efficiency gain allowed for reduced CPU utilization, making the models more power-efficient by allowing the CPU to handle other tasks simultaneously.</p>
                <p>In addition to building the package, I developed a comprehensive set of testing tools to ensure these optimizations were stable across different NPU configurations, preventing performance regressions. I also implemented a graph comparison script using graph isomorphism techniques, which expedited the process of checking compatibility with frequently updated LLM versions. This script saved the team approximately five man-hours each week and streamlined the deployment process, ensuring that AMD’s global Copilot+ deployment remained robust and performant.</p>
                <p>Through these contributions, I directly supported AMD's mission to optimize AI solutions for global deployment, demonstrating the importance of efficient, production-level code in high-performance environments.</p>

            <div id="ultrahive" class="dropdown-content">
                <h3>MASTH Ultrahive Healthcare Pvt Ltd</h3>
                <p>At MASTH Ultrahive Healthcare Pvt Ltd, a startup dedicated to promoting emotional wellness among teenagers in India, I worked as part of the Business Growth team to build and execute Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies that significantly expanded the startup's online reach and presence. My focus was on raising awareness for mental health in teenagers by creating a strong digital presence and engaging target audiences through strategic online campaigns.</p>
                <p>My role included conducting extensive market research to understand the competitive landscape and identify opportunities for MASTH to stand out. I designed and developed the company’s website and landing pages, conducting A/B tests to improve conversion rates, and running digital advertising campaigns on platforms like Google and Facebook. These campaigns brought over 100,000 impressions and drove targeted traffic to our platforms, effectively raising awareness and engagement.</p>
                <p>Through detailed analysis of visitor behavior and campaign performance, I optimized our strategies to generate quality leads, achieving a conversion rate of 5% from over 2,000 unique visitors. This digital approach greatly increased the startup’s visibility, as it had previously relied mostly on word-of-mouth and local outreach to schools. My contributions were recognized, and I was awarded Best Intern out of 25 interns. I was also invited to continue working with the company, highlighting the impact of my work on supporting the well-being of young people in India.</p>
                <p>By leveraging a data-driven approach to digital marketing, I helped MASTH engage with a broader audience and demonstrated the importance of innovative solutions in promoting mental wellness. This internship honed my skills in market research, digital marketing, and the practical application of business growth strategies in a socially impactful domain.</p>
