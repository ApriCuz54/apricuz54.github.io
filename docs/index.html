                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Aditya Chatterjee, an enthusiastic problem solver with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, and have worked on several exciting projects in the field of Computer Science, more specifically Deep Learning.</p>
                <p>I've interned at AMD, where I worked on a team focused on optimizing deep learning models and enabling Copilot+ for Ryzen AI devices, enhancing performance and efficiency. Previously, I also worked as a Business Growth Intern at Ultrahive Healthcare, where I contributed to go-to-market strategies and digital marketing campaigns.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball as part of the BITS Goa team and I have also achieved Grade 8 certification in Western Classical Guitar.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my projects below and check out my GitHub!</p>
